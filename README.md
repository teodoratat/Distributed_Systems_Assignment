# Energy management application
## Overview
This project is a demonstration of a full-stack application built using Java Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. It follows a microservices architecture with synchronous communication between services using REST APIs and asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ queues. The application also incorporates WebSocket integration for real-time notifications and chat services. Additionally, Spring Security is implemented for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to resources. CRUD operations are supported for managing entities within the system.
